# üç∑ Wine Dataset Classification

## Goal
Classify wines into 3 categories based on 13 chemical features.

## Tools
Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Methods
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier

## Result
Achieved ~90% accuracy in predicting wine classes.

## File Structure
- `wine_classification_knn.ipynb` : Main Jupyter Notebook with all analysis and modeling

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open `wine_classification_knn.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.
